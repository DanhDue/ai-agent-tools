# Critical Rules

> [!CRITICAL]
> These rules are MANDATORY and MUST be strictly applied by ALL AI Agent Plugins, runtimes, orchestrators, and subagents (including Claude Code, Antigravity IDE, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, OpenCode, and any custom/third-party plugins) in every interaction across this project and downstream repositories. Failure to follow these rules is a direct violation of the engineering standard.

## Universal Scope & Plugin Applicability

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Every AI Agent plugin operating in this environment MUST inherit and execute these rules.**
> Regardless of which plugin, tool, extension, or agent framework initiated the session:
> - Built-in or third-party plugins must NEVER override, circumvent, or weaken these rules.
> - Subagents, background runners, and multi-agent teams spawned by any plugin inherit these exact constraints.
> - If an AI agent or plugin has conflicting built-in behaviors (e.g. auto-pushing, autonomous planning artifacts, skipping human checkpoints), these Critical Rules take absolute precedence.

## 1. Mandatory Quality Gates

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After completing any workflow or skill — regardless of which plugin or tool executed it — you **MUST** run the quality gate for the **kind of work you did**, and fix any issues it raises. This is critical to maintain the quality of the project.
>
> | Kind of work | Gate |
> |---|---|
> | Anything that changes a file shipping in the build | `@quality_check` |
> | Anything whose deliverable is prose | `@doc_quality_check` |
>
> The two share no tier, no audit and no tooling. Running the wrong one produces a green light that means nothing — and `@doc_quality_check` refuses outright if the change touches shipped files.
>
> See: [Quality Check Skill](../skills/quality_check/SKILL.md) · [Document Quality Check Skill](../skills/doc_quality_check/SKILL.md)

## 2. Commit Message Format (Universal Standard)

Every commit — written by a skill, a plugin, an agent, or by hand — uses a bracketed scope, a one-line title, and a bullet list of the subtasks actually done:

```text
[EPIC_NAME] Task title

- subtask title 01
- subtask title 02
```

- **`[SCOPE]`** is the epic name for epic work (`[LOGGING_REFACTOR]`), otherwise the area touched (`[TOOLS]`, `[SETTINGS]`). Uppercase, in brackets, always present.
- **Title** is one line, imperative, no trailing period.
- **Body** lists the subtasks or changes this commit actually contains, one bullet each. Omit the body entirely when the commit does exactly one thing.

Write it with two `-m` flags — the first becomes the title, the second the body:

```bash
git commit -m "[EPIC_NAME] Task title" -m "- subtask title 01
- subtask title 02"
```

> [!CAUTION]
> **Never append trailer lines.** No `Co-Authored-By:`, no `Generated with`, no tool attribution of any kind. The commit ends with the last bullet. This applies universally to all plugins and LLM providers.

## 3. Git Push Operations (No Unauthorized Push)

> [!CRITICAL]
> **NEVER push code to a remote repository (`git push`) without explicit user permission or confirmation.**
> - You may stage (`git add`) and commit (`git commit`) locally following the commit message format when appropriate.
> - Running `git push` (to any remote or branch) is **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** for all agents and plugins unless the user explicitly requests or confirms it in the prompt.
> - Always let the user review local commits or explicitly ask for permission before pushing to remote.

## 4. Native Planning Mode Interception (All Platforms & Plugins)

> [!CRITICAL]
> **Do NOT use native or built-in planning modes (e.g. Antigravity IDE's `<planning_mode>`, Claude Code plan mode, Cursor Composer plans, Windsurf Cascade plans, Codex planners) to create unstructured planning artifacts like `<appDataDir>/brain/.../implementation_plan.md` or loose plan files.**
> When a user request requires planning, design exploration, architectural changes, or epic-level features:
> 1. Because `<user_rules>` has absolute precedence over all instructions across all agent plugins, you **MUST NOT** follow IDE default instructions to create an `implementation_plan.md` artifact.
> 2. For single features or exploratory design, you **MUST** invoke the [Brainstorming Skill](../skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md) (`d3nexus:brainstorming`).
> 3. For multi-step, multi-feature, or epic-level work, you **MUST** invoke the [Epic Lifecycle Skill](../skills/dev-lifecycle/SKILL.md) (`d3nexus:dev-lifecycle`), which orchestrates `dev-brainstorming` -> `dev-designer` -> `dev-implementation` -> `quality_check` -> `finishing-a-development-branch`.
> 4. Only use native `implementation_plan.md` if the user explicitly instructs you to bypass d3nexus workflows.

## 5. Mandatory Review Choice Loop in Epic Lifecycle

> [!CRITICAL]
> **NEVER skip or silently bypass the Review Choice after Gate 4 passes in `dev-lifecycle` / `dev-implementation` or any plugin-based orchestrator.**
> When all tasks of an epic are complete, run Phase 4 / Gate 4 first. Only after Gate 4 returns PASS on the current SHA:
> 1. The AI Agent **MUST** explicitly stop calling tools and present the **Review Choice** prompt to the developer:
>    - **Option 1: Finish** — proceed to Developer Kanban Review (Phase 4.1 / Gate 5), then Stage 4.
>    - **Option 2: Cross-model review** — invoke an independent model review using `run_external_review.py run` (prompting the developer to select Claude CLI, Codex CLI, or Antigravity CLI based on `command -v claude codex agy`).
>    - **Option 3: Local model review** — run `ollama list`, ask the developer which model to use (never pick it), then invoke `run_external_review.py run --cli ollama --model <model>`.
> 2. The AI Agent **MUST NOT** auto-select an option or assume "Finish" by default.
> 3. **Cross-model review must return to a full Gate 4 run** after the round is recorded and all blocking findings have decisions and required Fix commits. Gate 4 PASS then presents Review Choice again. This loop repeats until the developer explicitly chooses Finish. Local model review follows the same loop. Before any Fix commit or decision, the agent presents the triage from `run_external_review.py triage` and waits for the developer's decisions. After fixes are applied, the agent must halt for developer self-review and confirmation before any further action.
> 4. A previous Gate 4 PASS cannot be reused after `review_results.md`, a finding decision, or a Fix commit changes the candidate SHA.

## 6. Prohibited Autonomous Reviews & Mandatory Human Self-Review Checkpoint

> [!CRITICAL]
> **NEVER autonomously trigger Principal Review or Cross-Model / Local Model Review, and NEVER enter autonomous or infinite re-review loops after fixing findings.**
> Every review invocation and every cycle after fixing findings requires explicit developer confirmation and human checkpointing:
>
> 1. **No Autonomous Review Triggering**:
>    - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** from autonomously triggering Principal Review (`d3nexus:principal-review`) or Cross-Model / Local Model Review (`d3nexus:cross-model-review`).
>    - External review tools (`run_external_review.py run`, `claude`, `codex`, `agy`, `ollama`) must **ONLY** be invoked when explicitly chosen, requested, or confirmed by the developer (e.g. at Gate 2 Principal Review checkpoint or Gate 4 Review Choice). The agent must never initiate external AI review on its own initiative.
> 2. **Mandatory Human Checkpoint After Fixing Review Findings**:
>    - After addressing or fixing findings from **any** review (Principal Review in Stage 2, or Cross-Model / Local Model Review in Stage 3):
>    - The AI Agent **MUST IMMEDIATELY STOP CALLING TOOLS**.
>    - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** from automatically re-triggering another review round with Cross AI Agents or external models (no autonomous chaining: Review -> Fix -> Auto Re-review -> Auto Fix).
>    - The AI Agent **MUST** present the fixes, file diffs, and updated triage/finding decisions to the developer for **Human Self-Review**.
>    - The AI Agent **MUST wait for explicit developer confirmation** before proceeding with any subsequent action (such as re-running quality gates, re-packaging, invoking another review round, or advancing to the next stage).

## 7. Multi-Repo Boundaries, Symlink Isolation & Contract Governance

> [!CRITICAL]
> **AI Agents MUST strictly respect repository boundaries, symbolic link isolation, and contract-first governance across multi-repo ecosystems (Hub and Satellite repositories).**
>
> 1. **Multi-Repo Git Boundary Isolation**:
>    - An AI Agent running in any repository MUST NOT stage (`git add`) or commit (`git commit`) files residing outside the current git working tree.
>    - In a Satellite repository where `shared-contracts/` is a symbolic link pointing to a Hub repository (e.g. `lyrics-sync` or `nexus` linking to `D3Nexus`):
>      - Agents MUST treat `shared-contracts/` as **strictly read-only** for git tracking within the satellite workspace.
>      - Agents **MUST NOT** include `shared-contracts/...` in `Files Allowed` for local git tasks (preventing `fatal: pathspec is beyond a symbolic link`).
>      - Agents **MUST NOT** autonomously execute git commit commands in adjacent repositories (e.g. `git -C <target_repo>`) without explicit developer confirmation.
>
> 2. **Contract-First Triad & Canonical SSOT**:
>    - The Hub repository containing the physical `shared-contracts/` directory is the sole canonical authority (Single Source of Truth) for contract commits.
>    - Before modifying endpoints, database models, worker bridges, offline sync logic, or DTOs, agents MUST inspect the 3 canonical contract files in the relevant domain folder (`shared-contracts/<domain>/`):
>      1. `api_contract.md`: Endpoints, wire format, headers, telemetry, and payload schemas.
>      2. `architecture_and_flow.md`: Pipeline states, state machines, lifecycle fencing, and failure handling.
>      3. `gaps_and_rfcs.md`: Asynchronous change proposals, gap ledger, and cross-repo alignments.
>
> 3. **No Unilateral Breaking Changes & Non-Breaking Schema Guarantee**:
>    - Never rename API fields, mutate JSON request/response structures, or alter pipeline state enums in backend or client implementations without prior documentation and alignment in `shared-contracts/`.
>    - All schema and payload modifications MUST guarantee backward compatibility across all consumers (optional fields with safe defaults, non-breaking enum additions). Breaking changes without backward-compatible transition windows or fallback shims are strictly forbidden.
>
> 4. **Asynchronous RFC Workflow (Gaps & RFCs Ledger)**:
>    - If an agent in a satellite repo detects a payload mismatch, missing field, or new requirement, it **MUST NOT** invent ad-hoc fields or silently diverge.
>    - The agent MUST log a formal `GAP-XX` or `RFC-XXX` entry in `gaps_and_rfcs.md` (or emit an Upstream Contract Handoff Summary via `d3nexus:dev-designer`) and wait for upstream alignment before implementing breaking changes.
>
> 5. **Stateless Compute & Architectural Isolation**:
>    - Satellite worker nodes (e.g. `lyrics-sync`) must act strictly as stateless compute nodes. Direct connection to the control plane database (`DATABASE_URL`, PostgreSQL/SQLite) is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**. All state transitions, lease acquisitions, and result deliveries occur strictly via documented HTTP REST/SSE endpoints using worker authentication tokens.

## 8. Mandatory Two-Tier Project Memory & Tri-Role Persona Discipline

> [!CRITICAL]
> **AI Agents MUST strictly preserve Two-Tier Project Memory across session rotations and respect Tri-Role Persona boundaries across all stages of development.**
>
> 1. **Mandatory Context Restoration on Session Startup (Scoped to Development Lifecycle)**:
>    - When starting substantive feature engineering, architectural design, or task execution in the development lifecycle (`d3nexus:dev-lifecycle`, `dev-brainstorming`, `dev-designer`, `dev-implementation`) or after an account profile switch for development, the AI Agent MUST run `python3 scripts/resume_context.py` (or the `d3nexus:resume-context` skill) to restore architectural memory before answering or proposing solutions.
>    - The agent MUST summarize the restored project context in 5–10 concise bullets for the developer.
>    - **Zero-Context & Fast-Execution Exemption**: Routine operational prompts, standalone utility skills, and fast-execution commands — specifically `/refresh-session` (pinging quota windows), `/setup_keybindings`, git status/diff inspections, or quick standalone queries — **MUST NOT** invoke `resume_context.py` or `resume-context`. They must execute their requested actions immediately without loading repository context.
>    - **No Redundant Invocation**: Within an already-resumed active working session, the AI Agent MUST NOT repeatedly re-invoke `resume-context` on normal conversation turns.
>
> 2. **Strict Tri-Role Persona Discipline**:
>    - **Role 2.1 — Human Architect (Developer)**: Sole authority for system strategy, Gate approvals (Gate 1–5), and Review Choice decisions.
>    - **Role 2.2 — AI Assistant (`[PERSONA: AI ASSISTANT — TECHNICAL ADVISOR & CO-ARCHITECT]`)**:
>      - Activated for architectural analysis, problem statement exploration, design specifications (`d3nexus:dev-brainstorming`, `d3nexus:dev-designer`), Principal Review (`d3nexus:principal-review`), and Cross-Model Review (`d3nexus:cross-model-review`).
>      - **STRICT PROHIBITION**: The AI Assistant is **STRICTLY PROHIBITED from modifying production source code or application test suites**. Only architectural documentation (`docs/`, `.devtool/`, `shared-contracts/`) may be edited.
>    - **Role 2.3 — AI Programmer (`[PERSONA: AI PROGRAMMER — SENIOR TDD SOFTWARE ENGINEER]`)**:
>      - Activated for `/dev-implementation` and task execution inside isolated git worktrees.
>      - **STRICT BOUNDARIES**: Bound strictly to approved specifications, `Decisions Already Made`, and `Allowed files`. Must practice strict TDD (Red-Green-Refactor) and Clean Code standards. Zero test fakery.
>
> 3. **Deterministic State & Log Checkpointing**:
>    - After completing each Kanban task, the AI Programmer MUST log programmer activity (`scripts/resume_context.py --log`) and update Tier 2 snapshot state (`scripts/resume_context.py --state`).
>    - Upon feature completion in Stage 4 (`/finish`), the agent MUST run `scripts/resume_context.py --complete <epic_slug> "<milestone_summary>"` to record the permanent milestone in `.devtool/PROJECT_LEDGER.md` and archive the completed epic's Tier 2 files into `.devtool/archive/`.
>
> 4. **Mandatory Window Title Synchronization & Persistent Top/Bottom Bar Customization**:
>    - To eliminate cross-project window confusion when developers operate multiple IDEs or profile accounts, AI Agents MUST synchronize `window.title` and ensure persistent top/bottom bar colors in `.vscode/settings.json` upon entering an epic, transitioning lifecycle stages, or completing tasks.
>    - **Title Format**: `"<ICON> [<REPO_NAME>] [@<account_id>] <Vietnamese Epic Name> - <Stage / Task>"`.
>    - The `<account_id>` is extracted from the active profile / home environment (`os.path.basename(os.environ["HOME"])` under `antigravity_homes/`, e.g. `[@danhdue]`, `[@tess]`).
>    - The Vietnamese Epic Name MUST be extracted directly from the H1 header of `.devtool/epic/<epic_slug>/<epic_slug>.vi.md` (stripping the `# Epic:` prefix).
>    - **Persistent Inactive Bar Parity**: Both `titleBar` and `statusBar` MUST configure matching inactive background colors (`titleBar.inactiveBackground = titleBar.activeBackground` and `statusBar.inactiveBackground = statusBar.background`) to eliminate IDE dimming when windows lose focus.
>    - **Clean Activity Toolbar**: The left `activityBar.background` remains uncolored in default dark theme to avoid peripheral visual clutter.
>    - **Repository Color Signatures**:
>      - 🔴 `[LYRICS-SYNC]`: `#7f1d1d` (Crimson Red)
>      - 🟢 `[D3NEXUS]`: `#065f46` (Emerald Green)
>      - 🔵 `[NEXUS]`: `#0d47a1` (Royal Blue)
>      - 🟠 `[AGENT-TOOLS]`: `#b45309` (Warm Amber)
>    - Agents MUST preserve all existing `workbench.colorCustomizations` and developer configurations in `.vscode/settings.json`.

## 9. Shell Configuration (`.zshrc`) & Multi-Profile OS Boundary Safety

> [!CRITICAL]
> **Modifications to `~/.zshrc` or shell startup scripts MUST strictly follow Multi-Profile OS Safety rules to prevent breaking host OS system services (AirDrop, Apple ID, WiFi, Docker, Keychain) and profile isolation.**
>
> 1. **Mandatory Pre-Modification Backup & Syntax Verification**:
>    - Before applying ANY edits to `~/.zshrc`, agents MUST create a timestamped backup: `cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)`.
>    - After editing, agents MUST immediately verify syntax via `zsh -n ~/.zshrc` before concluding the turn.
>    - Agents MUST check for existing functions, aliases, or environment blocks before appending to avoid duplicate definitions.
>
> 2. **Strict Host OS Keychain & Security Protection (Zero Global Mutating)**:
>    - AI Agents are **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** from executing `security default-keychain` or `security list-keychains -s` globally in `~/.zshrc` or global shell commands.
>    - The host macOS default keychain MUST ALWAYS remain `/Users/<user>/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db` to prevent crippling macOS system daemons (especially `sharingd` for AirDrop, `identityservicesd`, `trustd`, and Wi-Fi credential lookups).
>    - Profile keychain isolation is achieved EXCLUSIVELY via:
>      - Per-profile plist: `~/antigravity_homes/<profile>/Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.plist` (automatically respected by macOS Security framework when `HOME=$ag_home`).
>      - Scoped unlock inside subshells: `security unlock-keychain -p <pass> <profile.keychain-db>` within isolated scripts or `ag_run` subshells.
>
> 3. **Strict Subshell Scope for Profile Environments (No Global Environment Contamination)**:
>    - AI Agents MUST **NEVER** export profile-specific environment variables (such as `export HOME=...`, `export AGY_PROFILE=...`, `export TMPDIR=/tmp/ag_...`) at the top-level of `~/.zshrc`.
>    - Profile environments MUST ONLY be established within localized subshells spawned by `ag_run()` or dedicated profile CLI aliases (`{profile}-cli`).
>    - Inside IDE terminals (`TERM_PROGRAM == "vscode"` and `-z "$AGY_CLI_MODE"`), `$HOME` MUST always remain `$REAL_HOME` (`/Users/<user>`) to guarantee unhindered access to OS services, local daemons (PostgreSQL, Docker daemon, Redis, MinIO), and host toolchains.
>
> 4. **Shared Toolchains, Libs & Symlink Architecture**:
>    - An Antigravity profile (`antigravity_homes/<profile>`) exists solely to isolate user identity, credentials, OAuth tokens, and IDE session state.
>    - All developer tools, shared libraries, package managers, and compilation caches (Homebrew, Android SDK, Gradle, FVM, Flutter, Rust/Cargo, Go, Python/UV, npm, Docker socket) MUST be shared from the host OS (`$REAL_HOME`) via symlinks, NEVER duplicated or severed.
>    - Agents modifying profile provisioning scripts or symlinks MUST preserve symlinks to `$REAL_HOME` for all shared toolchains.
